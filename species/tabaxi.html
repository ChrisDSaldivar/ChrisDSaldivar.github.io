            <p>Created by the Cat Lord—a divine being of the Upper Planes—to blend the qualities of humanoids and cats, tabaxi are a varied people in both attitude and appearance. In some lands, tabaxi live like the cats they resemble, naturally curious and at home in playful environments. In other places, tabaxi live as other folk do, not exhibiting the feline behavior the Cat Lord intended.</p>
<p>Tabaxi’s appearance is as varied as their attitudes. Some tabaxi have features or patterning in their fur like tigers, jaguars, or other big cats, while others have appearances more like a house cat. Still others have unique patterns or might style their fur to their preferences—or might even be hairless!</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
            
            
                <h2 id="TabaxiTraits">Tabaxi Traits</h2>
            As a tabaxi, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
                <span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Size</h4>
                <span><p>You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Speed</h4>
                <span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Cat’s Claws</h4>
                <span><p>You can use your claws to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Cat’s Talent</h4>
                <span><p>You have proficiency in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Perception</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Stealth</a> skills.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Darkvision</h4>
                <span><p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Feline Agility</h4>
                <span><p>Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.</p></span>
