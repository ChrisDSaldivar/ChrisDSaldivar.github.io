            <p>Originating in the Feywild—a realm of pure emotion— satyrs thrive on the energy of merriment. They resemble elves but have goatlike legs, cloven hooves, and ram or goat horns. The magic of the fey realm has given them an innate ability to perform, to delight, and to resist magical intrusion. While they’re usually found in the Feywild, satyrs do wander to other planes of existence, most often to the Material Plane. There they seek to bring a bit of their home plane’s splendor to other worlds.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
            
            
                <h2 id="SatyrTraits">Satyr Traits</h2>
            As a satyr, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
                <span><p>You are a Fey.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Size</h4>
                <span><p>You are Medium.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Speed</h4>
                <span><p>Your walking speed is 35 feet.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Ram</h4>
                <span><p>You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Magic Resistance</h4>
                <span><p>You have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Mirthful Leaps</h4>
                <span><p>Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as normal.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Reveler</h4>
                <span><p>As an embodiment of revelry, you have proficiency in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/18-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Performance</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/19-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Persuasion</a> skills, and you have proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice.</p></span>
