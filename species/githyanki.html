            <p>Once members of a people who escaped servitude to mind flayers, githyanki split from their cousins, githzerai, and fled to the Astral Plane. In that timeless, silvery realm, githyanki honed their psionic powers and built a great city called Tu’narath. They have since spread throughout the multiverse, starting in outposts outside the Astral Plane, called creches, where time passes and their children can reach adulthood.</p>
<p>A lanky people with skin tones of yellows, greens, and browns, githyanki complement their physical prowess with psionic might, instilled in them by mind flayers and cultivated over eons in the Astral Plane. Now all githyanki can use their psychic bond with that plane to access splinters of knowledge left behind by beings who travel, live, and die among the silver astral clouds.</p>
<p>Githyanki who reside in the Astral Plane can live indefinitely.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
            
            
                <h2 id="GithyankiTraits">Githyanki Traits</h2>
            As a githyanki, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
                <span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Size</h4>
                <span><p>You are Medium.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Speed</h4>
                <span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Astral Knowledge</h4>
                <span><p>You can mystically access a reservoir of experiences of entities connected to the Astral Plane. Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and with one weapon or tool of your choice, selected from the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, as you momentarily project your consciousness into the Astral Plane. These proficiencies last until the end of your next long rest.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Githyanki Psionics</h4>
                <span><p>You know the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2173-mage-hand" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">mage hand</a> cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait.</p>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2161-jump" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2161-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">jump</a> spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2195-misty-step" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2195-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">misty step</a> spell with it. Once you cast <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2161-jump" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2161-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">jump</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2195-misty-step" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2195-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">misty step</a> with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p>
<p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells require spell components when you cast them with this trait.</p></span>
            
                <h4>Psychic Resilience</h4>
                <span><p>You have resistance to psychic damage.</p></span>
