<p>Shadar-kai are the elves of the Shadowfell, originally drawn to that dread realm by the Raven Queen. Over the centuries, some of them have continued to serve her, while others have ventured into the Material Plane to forge their own destinies.</p>
<p>Once shadar-kai were Fey like the rest of their elven kin; now they exist in a state between life and death, thanks to being transformed by the Shadowfell’s grim energy.</p>
<p>Shadar-kai have ashen skin tones, and while they’re in the Shadowfell, they also become wizened, reflecting the somber nature of that gloomy plane.</p>
<p>Like other elves, shadar-kai can live to be over 750 years old.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
<h2 id="Shadar-kaiTraits">Shadar-kai Traits</h2>
            As a shadar-kai, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
<span><p>You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.</p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>You are Medium.</p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Blessing of the Raven Queen</h4>
<span><p>As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.</p></span>
<h4>Darkvision</h4>
<span><p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p></span>
<h4>Fey Ancestry</h4>
<span><p>You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition">charmed</a> condition on yourself.</p></span>
<h4>Keen Senses</h4>
<span><p>You have proficiency in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Perception</a> skill.</p></span>
<h4>Necrotic Resistance</h4>
<span><p>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</p></span>
<h4>Trance</h4>
<span><p>You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.</p>
<p>Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.</p></span>
