        Leonin

</h1>
<p>
        The leonin guard the shining lands of Oreskos, a golden plain where even
        the gods rarely trespass.
      </p>
<p>
        Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other
        peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing
        the treachery of strangers.
      </p>
<p>
        Still, some leonin wonder what lies beyond Oreskos’s border mountains
        and seek to test themselves in a wider world.
      </p>
<h3 id="NobleandFierce">Noble and Fierce</h3>
<p>
        Leonin tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that
        suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some
        grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands
        prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, leonin have retractable
        feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their
        ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that
        readily shifts between regal and fearsome. Leonin often act with
        confidence, which can come off as imperiousness. While this can reassure
        their allies, it can also suggest defiance in the face of what they
        perceive as imposed authority or unworthy experts.
      </p>
<h3 id="QuicktoQuarrel">Quick to Quarrel</h3>
<p>
        Other peoples often perceive leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant
        of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many leonin simply enjoy
        fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument,
        wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to
        exercise their minds and bodies. It follows, too, that leonin aren’t
        inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to
        an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin’s superiority
        proven), the insult is forgotten—along with the vanquished foe.
      </p>
<h3 id="PrideandSelf-Reliance">Pride and Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>
        Few leonin devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago,
        the leonin worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of
        their prides suffered depravities at the hands of the tyrant Agnomakhos,
        most leonin rejected the gods. It’s not that they deny the existence of
        deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy
        of adoration. The Leonin and the Gods table suggests the range of
        attitudes that leonin might adopt toward the gods.
      </p>
<p>
        Leonin rely on themselves and their prides. A pride is bound together by
        the experience of a shared challenge and, in particular, the sacred act
        of the hunt. See chapter 3 for more details on Oreskos and the leonin
        who call that land home.

<h2 id="LeoninTraits">Leonin Traits</h2>
      Your leonin character has the following racial traits.

      <h4>Ability Score Increase</h4>
<span><p>
          Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score
          increases by 1.
        </p></span>
<h4>Age</h4>
<span><p>Leonin mature and age at about the same rate as humans.</p></span>
<h4>Alignment</h4>
<span><p>
          Leonin tend toward good alignments. Leonin who are focused on the
          pride lean toward lawful good.
        </p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>
          Leonin are typically over 6 feet tall, with some standing over 7 feet.
          Your size is Medium.
        </p>
<p>
          Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with
          rolling a size modifier:
        </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Size modifier = 2d10</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">
          Height = 5 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches
        </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">
          Weight in pounds = 180 + (2d6 × your size modifier)
        </p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Darkvision</h4>
<span><p>
          You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
          light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color
          in darkness, only shades of gray.
        </p></span>
<h4>Claws</h4>
<span><p>
          Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed
          strikes. If you hit with them, you can deal slashing damage equal to
          1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal
          for an unarmed strike.
        </p></span>
<h4>Hunter’s Instincts</h4>
<span><p>
          You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:
          <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Athletics</a>,
          <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/17-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Intimidation</a>,
          <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Perception</a>, or
          <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Survival</a>.
        </p></span>
<h4>Daunting Roar</h4>
<span><p>
          As a bonus action, you can let out an especially menacing roar.
          Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must
          succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
          <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition">frightened</a>
          of you until the end of your next turn. The DC of the save equals 8 +
          your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this
          trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
        </p></span>
<h4>Languages</h4>
<span><p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Leonin.</p></span>
