    <p>
      Feathered folk who resemble ravens, kenku are blessed with keen
      observation and supernaturally accurate memories. None of them can
      remember the origin of the first kenku, however, and they often joke that
      there are as many kenku origin stories as there are kenku. Some of them
      paint their genesis as a curse, being a flightless bird people doomed to
      mimic other people’s creations. Other kenku recite cryptic but beautiful
      poems about their advent being a blessed event in which they were sent
      into the multiverse to observe and catalog its many wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever their true origin, kenku are most often found in the Shadowfell
      and the Material Plane, and they tend to have the coloration typical of
      ravens.

    <h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
    <p>
      At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human
      race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow
      these additional rules during character creation.
    </p>
    <h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
    <p>
      When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2
      and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by
      1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the
      scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your
      character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can
      follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your
      scores above 20.
    </p>
    <h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
    <p>
      Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language
      that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The
      <em
        ><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb"
          >Player’s Handbook</a
        ></em
      >
      offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that
      list for a campaign.
    </p>
    <h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
    <p>
      Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special
      tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most
      player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your
      character’s creature type is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order:
      Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend,
      Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have
      rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain
      types in different ways. For example, the
      <a
        class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
        href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds"
        data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1"
        >cure wounds</a
      >
      spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.
    </p>
    <h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
    <p>
      The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is
      about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an
      adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for
      centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century,
      that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.
    </p>
    <h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
    <p>
      Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges
      of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to
      determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the
      <a
        href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable"
        >Random Height and Weight</a
      >
      table in the
      <em
        ><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb"
          >Player’s Handbook</a
        ></em
      >, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you
      imagine for your character.
    </p>

    <h2 id="KenkuTraits">Kenku Traits</h2>
    As a kenku, you have the following racial traits.

    <h4>Creature Type</h4>
    <span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>

    <h4>Size</h4>
    <span
      ><p>
        Your size is Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this
        race.
      </p></span
    >

    <h4>Speed</h4>
    <span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>

    <h4>Expert Duplication</h4>
    <span
      ><p>
        When you copy writing or craftwork produced by yourself or someone else,
        you have advantage on any ability checks you make to produce an exact
        duplicate.
      </p></span
    >

    <h4>Kenku Recall</h4>
    <span
      ><p>
        Thanks to your supernaturally good memory, you have proficiency in two
        skills of your choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, when you make an ability check using any skill in which you
        have proficiency, you can give yourself advantage on the check before
        rolling the d20. You can give yourself advantage in this way a number of
        times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses
        when you finish a long rest.
      </p></span
    >

    <h4>Mimicry</h4>
    <span
      ><p>
        You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A
        creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations
        only with a successful Wisdom (<a

        modifier.
