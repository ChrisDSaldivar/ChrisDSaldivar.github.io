He grips the weightless sigil, twisting it to unleash streams of dark energy that curse the blood of the monster’s own veins to even the odds.</p>  <p>A mysterious half-elf swathed in a worn cloak and rugged leather armor carefully investigates the site of a roadway massacre, her eyes flashing with recognition as she meditates on the remnants of the grisly scene. Suddenly, she jumps to her feet, certain in the knowledge of what creature was responsible, where it can be found—and how little time she has before it kills again.</p>  <p>Stepping into lightless chambers filled with ancient dust and lingering whispers, the halfling picks up the warning of imminent danger from the scraping of bone and claw on nearby stone. She winces as she runs her blade across her palm, the steel transmuting blood and essence into glowing runes of powerful magic, eager to brand and burn the flesh of her enemies.</p>  <p>Blood hunters are clever warriors driven by an unending determination to destroy evils old and new. Armed with rites of secretive blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for their cause, they protect the realms from the shadows—even as they remain ever vigilant against being drawn to the darkness that consumes the monsters they hunt.</p>  <h2>Sacrifice to Preserve Life</h2>  <p>Far from the judging eyes of society, blood hunters have mastered the secretive techniques of hemocraft, finding blood magic’s esoteric nature effective against evils that resist divine rebuke or arcane bindings. Through careful study and practice, blood hunters hone the rites of hemocraft into unique combat techniques, forfeiting a portion of their own health to call blood curses down upon their enemies or summon the elements to aid their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force dedicated to protecting the innocent.</p>  <h2>A Monster to Fight Monsters</h2>  <p>Whether driven by the wish to make a difference, the need to take vengeance, or the hope of finding a place to belong in an uncaring world, every blood hunter has their own reasons for undertaking the ritual of the Hunter’s Bane that starts them on this path. In joining an order of blood hunters, one also joins a family bound by service to each other and a common cause. For many, this might be the only family they have left—or have ever known—making the kinship felt between blood hunters an all-but-unbreakable bond.</p>  <p>Outside the camaraderie of their orders, however, the life of a blood hunter is not an easy one. The ritual of the Hunter’s Bane can leave a character visibly changed, and prone to unsettling the people around them. Likewise, witnessing hemocraft can invoke superstitious fears from even the most learned scholars. While some cultures have come to accept the good deeds of many blood hunter orders, many blood hunters hide their calling unless absolutely necessary. They feel more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world, or drift through the outskirts of society, protecting the poor and defenseless from dark intention and the corrupting touch of fiends.</p>  <p>In choosing this path, every blood hunter irrevocably gives a part of themself to their cause—physically, emotionally, and sometimes morally. Each order of blood hunters practices its own ideals and methods, often employing techniques with dark origins that test the strength and will of those who employ them. Many wrestle with the fear of losing this struggle. And so a life of discipline and vigilance drives a blood hunter’s travels as they wander the countryside, in search of like-minded adventurers and whispers of dark deeds afoot.</p>  <h2>Creating a Blood Hunter</h2>  <p>As you create your blood hunter character, think about why you were driven to this lifestyle—and why you strive to give up everything to dwell in the darkness with the evils you hunt. Do you seek a sense of purpose and security, which you found among the order that has taken you in? Have you always carried a seed of darkness within you, so that you look for compatriots who can watch over and prevent you from succumbing to it? Were you once a holy warrior who strayed from your faith and was cast out, even as you yearn to give yourself over to the cause of protecting the innocent?</p>  <p>What is your relationship with the powers of hemocraft and the abilities it promises? Do you respect and fear the ancient power that surges through your veins, embracing your gifts and using them freely? Are you worried that this power will eventually turn you into one of the monsters you hunt? Or has your study instilled you with the confident clarity that makes you certain you can control these gifts for the greater good?</p>  <p>As well, what made you leave the comfort of your order to strike out on your own? Do you intend to return, or have you decided you have more to learn in the world? What strengths or assets do you seek in other adventurers that can help you meet your goals?</p>  <p>Though most blood hunters follow a path of good or neutrality in their pursuits, some have fallen to the dark, seductive side of hemocraft. These blood hunters use their abilities for selfish and evil purposes, often leading to their expulsion from the orders that trained them.</p>  <blockquote>  <p><span style="font-size: 18px"><strong>Quick Build</strong></span></p>  <p>You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength or Dexterity, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/weapon-properties/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">finesse</a> weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence, if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical power, or Constitution, if you want to have additional hit points to empower your abilities through sacrifice.

what you need to know if you choose blood hunter as one of your classes.</p>  <p><strong><em>Ability Score Minimum.</em></strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength score or

                Hunter’s Bane
            </h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you have survived the Hunter’s Bane—a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Survival</a>) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about such creatures.</p>
<p>The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hemocraft save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier<br>(your choice between Intelligence or Wisdom)</p>

                Blood Maledict

            <p>Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to channel—or sometimes sacrifice—a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You know one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the “<a title="Blood Curses" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#BloodCurses-1611383">Blood Curses</a>” section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new blood curse, you can also choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse.</p>
<p>Each time you use your Blood Maledict feature, you choose which curse to invoke from the curses you know. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by taking necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage can’t be reduced in any way. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood are immune to blood curses unless you have amplified the curse.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Blood Maledict twice between rests starting at 6th level, three times starting at 13th level, and four times starting at 17th level.</p>

            <p>Also at 2nd level, you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft that infuses your weapon strikes with elemental energy. As a bonus action, you can activate any rite you know on one weapon you’re holding. The effect of the rite lasts until you finish a short or long rest. When you activate a rite, you take necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.</p>
<p>While the rite is in effect, attacks you make with this weapon are magical, and deal extra damage equal to your hemocraft die of the type determined by the chosen rite. A weapon can hold only one active rite at a time. Other creatures can’t gain the benefit of your rite.</p>
<p>You choose one rite from the crimson rites below when you first gain this feature. You learn an additional crimson rite at 7th level, and again at 14th level.</p>
<p><strong>Rite of the Flame.</strong> The extra damage dealt by your rite is fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>Rite of the Frozen.</strong> The extra damage dealt by your rite is cold damage.</p>
<p><strong>Rite of the Storm.</strong> The extra damage dealt by your rite is lightning damage.</p>
<p><strong>Rite of the Dead.</strong> The extra damage dealt by your rite is necrotic damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)</p>
<p><strong>Rite of the Oracle.</strong> The extra damage dealt by your rite is psychic damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)</p>
<p><strong>Rite of the Roar.</strong> The extra damage dealt by your rite is thunder damage. (Prerequisite: 14th level)</p>

    <p>The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the blood hunter orders, its members having originally rediscovered the secrets of hemocraft and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mystery of the transition from life, and the unholy power that can cause the dead to rise once more. These zealous blood hunters make it their life’s work to destroy the scourge of undeath wherever it is found, tuning their abilities to engage undead creatures and those who manipulate the necromancy that creates them.</p>

</h2>
    <p>The ancient curse of lycanthropy is feared by nearly all peoples and cultures, passed through blood and seeding a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo “the Taming”—the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor-sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to their own hunger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px"><strong>The Burden of Lycanthropy</strong></span></p>
<p>Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible weight it imposes on them and the challenges it brings. Where most afflicted by the curse of lycanthropy grow wicked, deranged, and even murderous, Lycan blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and the power of their blood magic. A member of the Order of the Lycan cannot spread their curse through blood unless they wish to, and one of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another creature without the order’s sanction.</p>
<p>If a member of the Order of the Lycan is ever cured of their lycanthropic curse, it brings terrible shame to their name and the order. Members who have been cleansed against their will readily return to the order to undergo a renewed initiation of the Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring their honor.</p>
<p>Lycanthropy comes in many forms bound to specific beasts, with wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat the best-known variations. The particular strain of the lycanthropic curse defines the physical traits that manifest in a Lycan blood hunter’s hybrid transformation, even as the benefits the curse bestows remain relatively uniform.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>While you are transformed, you gain the following benefits and drawbacks:</p>
<p><em><strong>Feral Might.</strong></em> You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you have a +1 bonus to melee damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level.</p>
<p><em><strong>Resilient Hide.</strong></em> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. Additionally, while you are not wearing heavy armor, you have a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
<p><em><strong>Predatory Strikes.</strong></em> You can apply your Crimson Rite feature to your unarmed strikes, which you treat as one weapon. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 bludgeoning or slashing damage (your choice). This damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you use the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/1-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Attack</a> action to make an unarmed strike, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bloodlust.</strong></em> If you start your turn with fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or move directly toward the nearest creature and use the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/1-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">Attack</a> action against that creature. If you’re concentrating on a spell or are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (such as the barbarian’s Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</p>
<p>If you have your Extra Attack feature, you can choose whether to use it for this frenzied attack. If more than one creature is equally near to you, roll randomly to determine your target. Once your attack is resolved, you regain control of yourself.</p>
            
            <h4 id="Stalker'sProwess-1670004">
                Stalker's Prowess
            </h4>
            <p>At 7th level, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. Your hybrid form also gains the following additional benefit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Improved Predatory Strikes.</strong></em> You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with your unarmed strike. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 18th level. Additionally, when you have an active crimson rite on your unarmed strike while in your hybrid form, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
            
            <h4 id="AdvancedTransformation-1670108">
                Advanced Transformation
            </h4>
            <p>At 11th level, you learn to unleash and control more of the beast within. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature twice, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your hybrid form also gains the following additional benefit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lycan Regeneration.</strong></em> At the start of each of your turns when you have at least 1 hit point but fewer hit points than half your hit point maximum, you gain hit points equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). If you are in hybrid form, you gain these hit points before you must make the saving throw for your bloodlust.</p>
            
            <h4 id="BrandoftheVoracious-1670168">
                Brand of the Voracious
            </h4>
            <p>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on the saving throw for your bloodlust while in hybrid form. Additionally, your Brand of Castigation can now bind a foe to your hunter’s ferocity. While in your hybrid form, you have advantage on attack rolls against a creature branded by you.</p>
            
            <h4 id="HybridTransformationMastery-1670189">
                Hybrid Transformation Mastery
            </h4>
            <p>At 18th level, you have mastered your inner predator. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature an unlimited number of times, and your hybrid form lasts until you revert to your normal form, fall <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">unconscious</a>, or die.</p>
<p>You also gain the Blood Curse of the Howl for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.</p>

</h2>
    <p>The process of undertaking the Hunter’s Bane ritual is a painful, scarring, and sometimes fatal experience. Those who survive are irrevocably changed—and not always for the better. Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters honed the way in which hemocraft alters the body, using corrupted alchemy and toxic elixirs to alter their blood even further. Over time, they have modified their capabilities in battle, becoming something beyond what they once were. Calling themselves the Order of the Mutant, these blood hunters now specialize in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their foes, altering their biology to be best prepared for any conflict.</p>
    
            <h4 id="Mutagencraft-1668952">
                Mutagencraft
            </h4>
            <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to master forbidden alchemical formulas—known as mutagens—that can temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you consume a mutagen, whose effects and side effects last until you finish a short or long rest unless otherwise specified. While one or more mutagens are affecting you, you can use an action to focus and flush all mutagens from your system, ending their effects and side effects.</p>
<p>Mutagens are designed for the specific biology of the character who concocted them, and your mutagens have no effect on other creatures. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not used before you finish your next short or long rest.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>The number of mutagens you can concoct when you finish a rest, and the number of formulas you know, increases as you gain levels in the blood hunter class, as shown on the Mutagencraft table above. Additionally, when you learn a new mutagen formula, you can replace one formula you already know with a new mutagen formula. You choose four mutagen formulas to learn from the options detailed at the end of this subclass description, and you can concoct one mutagen when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            
            <h4 id="StrangeMetabolism-1668999">
                Strange Metabolism
            </h4>
            <p>When you reach 7th level, your body begins to adapt to toxins and venoms, ignoring their corrupting effects. You gain immunity to poison damage and the <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/11-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">poisoned</a> condition.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can trigger a burst of adrenaline that lets you temporarily resist the negative effects of a mutagen. As a bonus action, you can ignore the negative side effect of one mutagen affecting you for 1 minute. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>At 11th level, your mutagenic hemocraft lets your Brand of Castigation reveal a foe’s true nature. Any illusion or invisibility in effect on a creature when you brand it ends, and the creature can’t benefit from invisibility or illusion effects while branded by you. If a creature branded by you is in an alternative form (by way of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2209-polymorph" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2209-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">polymorph</a> spell, the Change Shape action or Shapechanger trait, the Wild Shape feature, and similar effects), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or revert to its true form and be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">stunned</a> until the end of your next turn.

            </h4>
            <p>Starting at 15th level, your blood curse can infuse a creature’s body with terrible toxins. You gain the Blood Curse of Corrosion for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn’t count against your number of blood curses known.</p>

            <p>At 18th level, your body has adapted to produce mutagens naturally in a moment of need. As a bonus action, choose one mutagen currently affecting you. Its effects and side effects end, and you can immediately have a mutagen you know the formula for take effect in its place.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

</h2>
    <p>Blood hunters belonging to the Order of the Profane Soul have pushed the limits of hemocraft for use against some of the most terrifying creatures corrupting the world. Ancient fiends and cruel magic-users have long counted on their ability to meld into the background and escape those who hunt them, vanishing into noble courts without a trace, or bending the minds of the most stalwart warriors with but a glance. So the blood hunters who founded this order trusted to their resilience as they delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater threats. And though they might have traded a part of themselves for their power, the members of this order know the benefits of that power far outweigh the price.</p>
    
            <h4 id="OtherworldlyPatron-5463384">
                Otherworldly Patron
            </h4>
            <p>When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, detailed in the <em><a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em></li>
<li>The Undying, from <em><a title="Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/scag">Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide</a></em></li>
<li>The Celestial or the Hexblade, from <em><a title="Xanathar’s Guide to Everything" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a></em></li>
<li>The Fathomless or the Genie, from <em><a title="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe">Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything</a></em></li>
<li>The Undead, from <em><a title="Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr">Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice you make augments some of your subclass features, as noted below.</p>
            
            <h4 id="PactMagic-5463385">
                Pact Magic
            </h4>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See <a title="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/order-of-the-profane-soul-wis/class-feature/5460750/chapter 10">chapter 10</a> of the <em><a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a title="chapter 11" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spells#WarlockSpells">chapter 11</a> of the <em><a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for the warlock spell list.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2323-witch-bolt" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2323-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">witch bolt</a>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong></em> At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 13th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong>&nbsp;Your chosen Hemocraft&nbsp;ability (Intelligence or Wisdom)&nbsp;is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your&nbsp;Hemocraft ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Hemocraft modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a conduit for the power of your pact with your chosen patron. While you have an active crimson rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact.</p>
<p><strong>The Archfey.</strong> When you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature glows with faint light until the end of your next turn.

<p><strong>The Fathomless.</strong> You can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
