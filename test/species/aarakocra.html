          Aarakocra

          <span class="compendium-header-subtitle">Species Details</span>
</h1>
<p>
          A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air,
          aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first
          aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa—mighty beings of air—and were
          imbued with a measure of their masters’ power over winds. Their
          descendants still command echoes of that power.
        </p>
<p>
          From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes
          called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the
          ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are
          typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that
          taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies—usually red,
          orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often
          resembling those of parrots or eagles.
        </p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>
          At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the
          human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race,
          follow these additional rules during character creation.
        </p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>
          When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score
          by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different
          scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to
          determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build”
          section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores
          to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you
          can’t raise any of your scores above 20.
        </p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>
          Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other
          language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.
          The
          <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>
          offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify
          that list for a campaign.
        </p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>
          Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a
          special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they
          are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you
          what your character’s creature type is.
        </p>
<p>
          Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order:
          Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey,
          Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types
          don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect
          creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the
          <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds">cure wounds</a>
          spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.
        </p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>
          The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse
          is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end
          on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can
          live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than
          a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.
        </p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>
          Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same
          ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d
          like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult
          the
          <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a>
          table in the
          <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you
          imagine for your character.
        </p>
<h2 id="AarakocraTraits">Aarakocra Traits</h2>
        As an aarakocra, you have the following racial traits.

        <h4>Creature Type</h4>
<span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>Your size is Medium.</p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Flight</h4>
<span><p>
            Because of your wings, you have a
            <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/rules/93-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#FlyingMovement">flying</a>
            speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed
            if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor.
          </p></span>
<h4>Talons</h4>
<span><p>
            You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you
            hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier
            slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an
            unarmed strike.
          </p></span>
<h4>Wind Caller</h4>
<span><p>
            Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the
            <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2134-gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a>
            spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once
            you cast the spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you
            finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell
            slots you have of 2nd level or higher.
          </p>
<p>
            Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
            it when you cast
            <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2134-gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a>
            with this trait (choose when you select this race).
