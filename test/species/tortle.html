<p>Tortles have a saying: “We wear our homes on our backs.” These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don’t have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads.</p>
<p>Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
<h2 id="TortleTraits">Tortle Traits</h2>
            As a tortle, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
<span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.</p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Claws</h4>
<span><p>You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p></span>
<h4>Hold Breath</h4>
<span><p>You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.</p></span>
<h4>Natural Armor</h4>
<span><p>Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You can’t wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.</p></span>
<h4>Nature’s Intuition</h4>
<span><p>Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/11-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Animal Handling</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/13-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Medicine</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/9-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Nature</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Perception</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Stealth</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Survival</a>.</p></span>
<h4>Shell Defense</h4>
<span><p>You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition">prone</a>, your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can’t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p></span>
