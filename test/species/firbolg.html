</h1>
<p>Distant cousins of giants, the first firbolgs wandered the primeval forests of the multiverse, and the magic of those forests entwined itself with the firbolgs’ souls. Centuries later, that magic still thrums inside a firbolg, even one who has never lived under the boughs of a great forest.</p>
<p>A firbolg’s magic is an obscuring sort, which allowed their ancestors to pass through a forest without disturbing it. So deep is the connection between a firbolg and the wild places of the world that they can communicate with flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Firbolgs can live up to 500 years.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
<h2 id="FirbolgTraits">Firbolg Traits</h2>
            As a firbolg, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
<span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>You are Medium.</p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Firbolg Magic</h4>
<span><p>You can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic">detect magic</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2069-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2069-disguise-self">disguise self</a> spells with this trait. When you use this version of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2069-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2069-disguise-self">disguise self</a>, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter or taller. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have.</p>
<p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).</p></span>
<h4>Hidden Step</h4>
<span><p>As a bonus action, you can magically turn <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition">invisible</a> until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p></span>
<h4>Powerful Build</h4>
<span><p>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p></span>
<h4>Speech of Beast and Leaf</h4>
<span><p>You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with Beasts, Plants, and vegetation. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.</p></span>
