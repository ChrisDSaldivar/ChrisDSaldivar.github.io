</h1>
<p>Some of the smallest draconic creatures in the multiverse, kobolds display their draconic ancestry in the glint of their scales and in their roars. Legends tell of the first kobolds emerging from the Underdark near the lairs of the earliest dragons. In some lands, kobolds serve chromatic or metallic dragons—even worshiping them as divine beings. In other places, kobolds know too well how dangerous those dragons can be and help others defend against draconic destruction.</p>
<p>Whatever their relationship to dragons, kobold scales tend to be rust colored, although the occasional kobold sports a scale color more akin to that of a chromatic or a metallic dragon. A kobold’s cry can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion expressed, their cry resonates with draconic power.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
<h2 id="KoboldTraits">Kobold Traits</h2>
            As a kobold, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
<span><p>You are a Humanoid.</p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>You are Small.</p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Darkvision</h4>
<span><p>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p></span>
<h4>Draconic Cry</h4>
<span><p>As a bonus action, you let out a cry at your enemies within 10 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies have advantage on attack rolls against any of those enemies who could hear you. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p></span>
<h4>Kobold Legacy</h4>
<span><p>Kobolds’ connection to dragons can manifest in unpredictable ways in an individual kobold. Choose one of the following legacy options for your kobold:</p>
<p><strong>Craftiness.</strong> You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/6-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Arcana</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Investigation</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/13-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Medicine</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/4-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Sleight of Hand</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Survival</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Defiance.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition">frightened</a> condition on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Draconic Sorcery.</strong> You know one cantrip of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for that cantrip (choose when you select this race).</p></span>
