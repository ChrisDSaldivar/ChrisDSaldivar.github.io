</h1>
<p>With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.</p>
<p>The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.</p>
<p>In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p>
<p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona’s previous users.</p>
<h2 id="CreatingYourCharacter">Creating Your Character</h2>
<p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityScoreIncreases">Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p>
<h4 id="Languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureType">Creature Type</h4>
<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p>
<h4 id="LifeSpan">Life Span</h4>
<p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p>
<h4 id="HeightandWeight">Height and Weight</h4>
<p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></em>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>
<h2 id="ChangelingTraits">Changeling Traits</h2>
            As a changeling, you have the following racial traits.
            
            
                <h4>Creature Type</h4>
<span><p>You are a Fey.</p></span>
<h4>Size</h4>
<span><p>You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.</p></span>
<h4>Speed</h4>
<span><p>Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p></span>
<h4>Changeling Instincts</h4>
<span><p>Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/16-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Deception</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Insight</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/17-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Intimidation</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/18-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Performance</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/19-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Persuasion</a>.</p></span>
<h4>Shapechanger</h4>
<span><p>As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of an individual you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.</p>
<p>You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</p></span>
